#MAJOR_PROJECT 
Credit Risk Analytics (Bondora Bank) ðŸŽ¯

Project Overview
This project aims to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify patterns that can help predict credit risk in loan applications. By understanding the driving factors behind loan defaults, we can support the decision-making process, ensuring that loans are approved for customers who are more likely to repay.

Problem Statement-
The goal is to identify variables that strongly indicate a clientâ€™s likelihood to default on a loan. The insights gained will assist in:
Approving loans for clients with a lower risk of default.
Denying or adjusting loans for clients with a higher risk of default.
Determining loan terms based on the risk profile of the applicant.

Dataset-
The dataset consists of three files:
Application_data.csv: Information about clients at the time of loan application, including whether they faced payment difficulties.
previous_application.csv: Data on clientsâ€™ previous loan applications, including the status of each application (Approved, Cancelled, Refused, Unused).
columns_description.csv: A data dictionary explaining the meaning of the variables.

Approach-
Data Cleaning: Handle missing values and outliers appropriately to prepare the dataset for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Utilize univariate, segmented univariate, and bivariate analysis to uncover important insights.
Visualization: Create plots and visualizations to represent data patterns clearly.
Insights & Recommendations: Summarize findings to provide actionable insights for credit risk management.

Results-
The project outcomes include:
Identification of key variables influencing credit risk.
Clear visualizations highlighting important patterns and correlations.
Business-driven recommendations to improve loan approval processes.
